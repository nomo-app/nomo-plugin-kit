# WebOn Packaging

For WebOns to be packaged into a tar.gz-archive, there are a few requirements needed.
For example, WebOns should always be client-site-rendered and include a few mandatory files in their tar.gz-archive.

See https://github.com/nomo-app/nomo-webon-kit/blob/main/demo-webon/package.json for an example of a build_tar script (`npm run build_tar`).

## Client Site Rendering

A WebOn should be a "static build" that is rendered on the client.
WebOns should not include any pages that are rendered on a server.
The reason for this is that WebOns are hosted on a localhost-server within the Nomo App (in production-mode).
Only in dev-mode, WebOns may be hosted on remote-servers.

It may depend on your framework how to achieve client site rendering; here are a few examples.

### Next.js

With Next.js-React, static builds may be done by configuring `output: 'export'` and running `next build && next export`.

See the following example of a `next.config.js` that can generate static builds: https://github.com/nomo-app/nomo-webon-kit/blob/main/demo-webon/next.config.js

### Svelte

TODO: Perhaps add link to a Svelte open source WebOn?

# Required files

The following files are required to be in a tar.gz-archive, otherwise the Nomo App could refuse to install the WebOn.

## Manifest

Every tar.gz-archive must include a `nomo_manifest.json`.
See https://github.com/nomo-app/nomo-webon-kit/blob/main/demo-webon/public/nomo_manifest.json for an example manifest.
See https://github.com/nomo-app/nomo-webon-kit/blob/main/api-docs/interfaces/NomoManifest.md for documentation about the manifest-properties.

## index.html

The tar.gz file should contain an "out" directory, which represents the output of the build files. Inside this "out" directory, the index.html file should be placed at the top level. It is crucial to ensure the presence of the "out" directory, housing the essential index.html file. The anticipated file path for the index.html should be "out/index.html". This particular file serves as the primary document for your WebOns interface.

## Icon

To ensure seamless integration, it is imperative to place your WebOn-Icon within the "out" directory, adhering to the specified file name: "icon.svg". Please note that our system exclusively supports SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image files. The anticipated pathway for the Icon should be "out/icon.svg".
