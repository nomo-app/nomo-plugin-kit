# The Future of Decentralized Apps

In our vision, Nomo WebOns belong to a *Third Generation of DApps* that has a vastly better user experience (UX) than previous generations.
To help you understand that vision, this document takes you on a journey back into the history of DApps.

## First Generation: DApps dictated by Pre-made UX

We journey back to 2018 when [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) made its debut in the Ethereum community.
EIP-1193 helped to enable an early wave of DApps through wallets such as MetaMask.

However, we assert that EIP-1193 is fundamentally flawed from a UX perspective.
The UX suffered because DApps were forced to passively adhere to the dictates of a wallet.

For instance, if a wallet altered its "network" or disconnected from a "network", then the DApp was forced to respond.

## Second Generation: DApps dictated by Middlemans

A new wave of DApps realized that the old way of connecting to wallets simply won't cut it.
This led to the creation of new "connection protocols".
As a result, DApps gained greater freedom to design their own UX.

But unfortunately, the market ended up in a situation where centralized players like [walletconnect.com](https://walletconnect.com) dictate the communcation between wallets and DApps.
This ended up in the ridiculous situation where even a wallet running on a phone needs to go over a middleman for connecting to a DApp that also runs on the same phone.

Needless to say, this is bad for the UX as it adds complexity and network delays.
Taking it a step further, the whole concept of a *"connect wallet button"* is highly questionable from a UX standpoint.

## Third Generation: Free DApps with unlimited UX

To liberate DApps from middlemans like walletconnect.com, we need to decentralize what should have been decentralized in the first place.

This is where the Nomo WebOn API comes into play.
Through Nomo WebOns, DApps and wallets communicate locally on the same phone, eliminating the need for a "connect wallet button."

More generally, wallets should offer services to DApps but not force them into any pre-made UX.
The only exception to this guideline is for tasks such as signing transactions, where pre-made dialogs are necessary to uphold security.
